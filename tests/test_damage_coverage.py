"""Regression tests for the damage-pipeline coverage gates (pre and post).

The Kumamoto run surfaced a defect: any post source served as a tile mosaic (aerial flights, XYZ
tiles) has gaps where individual tiles 404. Buildings on those gaps saw real pre + black post and
scored as confident 'destroyed'. The gate must catch them.
